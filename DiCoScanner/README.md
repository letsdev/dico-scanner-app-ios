Instructions

1. Create the Xcode Project in the ./ios/src/ios folder.
2. Look through the standard pom files and adjust them to your project. Replace the comments with your values. 
3. Add the CFBuildNumber and CFBundleVersion properties to the info.plist, otherwise maven build won't work.
4. Install xcpretty if you want to build locally.
